        <p>
            My name is Caroline.
            In 2016 I graduated with honors in Graphic Design in Warsaw, Poland. I moved to
            USA and was working for almost a year as a Graphic Artist in the company that was making promotional products. After that I started working as a Graphic Designer in a print shop where I work today. I am a hardworking, creative designer who is not afraid of
            new challenges and is willing to go extra mile to make sure that the clients gets exactly what they want.
